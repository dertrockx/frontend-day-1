# Assignment

Create a branch with your name as the branch name. Example: `git checkout -b cholo`.

Do the following:

- Implement winner detection and show the winner below the "Next player" text (same rules as tic-tac-toe)
- Make the "Reset" button work, on click it should clear the value of all the squares, make the next player reset to "O", and clear the winner if any
- Lift the state up again and put all the state and logic to game/index.js, all the other functionalities should still work

When you're done, create a pull request to master. Please reach out to PAD if you have any questions.
